### 1. Predicting the betrayal using the interaction between variables.

### 2. Abstract

In our project, we decide to use the dataset the same as the one we are given. Our goal is to predict whether a player will betray or not using the interaction between variables.
We found that in the paper, they only study the imbalance within each variables. In our opinion, it is a waste to only use an average value in explaination and prediction.
In our project, we want to extend their analysis by analyzing the interaction betweeen these variables. We guess when people betray, they might speak more while be more polite, 
or they would speak less while more impolite. We think there is an underlying correlations within these variables. We also want to use different techniches in machine learning
like SVM or deep learning to increase the accuracy of prediction.

### 3. Research Questions
 + Is the interaction between some variables related to the probability of betrayal?
 + Can we add these interaction to increase the accuracy of prediction?
 + Can we increase the accuracy of prediction by using different models in machine learning like random forest?

### 4. Proposed dataset
  We decide to use the dataset given by the paper. There are two main reasons we do this:
  + The first reason is to reduce unnecessary work. It is hard to find enough dataset for such a old game. It also take too much time to process the data. For example, we might 
  spend an extra time in learning Standford politeness test.
  + Another reason is that we can compare our result with the original paper directly. If we use different dataset, we might have high probability have different result due to 
  different preprocessing and different data. It is more convinced to say our model is better if our method increase the accuracy.

### 5. Methods
  + We use statistics test to find if the interaction between variables are helpful for predicting.
  + We add these interaction to see if we can increase the accuracy of the result based on their model.
  + Try other methods in machine learning like SVM, random forest and deep learning.

### 6. Proposed timeline
  + First discussion in 11.28. Spent 10 hours to replicate the original paper.
  + Second discussion in 12.05 & 12.06 . Spent 15 hours to extend our result.
  + Fix buges and write report 12.07 - 12.13. Spent 9 hours total to do this separately.
  + Make a video 12.14 - 12.18. Spend 3-5 hours to make a video.
